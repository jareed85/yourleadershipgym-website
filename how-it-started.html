    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>This platform wasn’t born in a boardroom or brainstormed in a slick VC pitch deck.</p>
    <p>It started with a personal challenge. I was looking for a way to sharpen my leadership edge, break out of a professional plateau, and build something real—something that would push people the way I needed to be pushed. Not with fluff, but with focus.</p>
    <p>So I did the reps. I built the habits. I tested the frameworks. Then I wrapped it in code, design, and a touch of AI because frankly, the world doesn’t need more leadership theory—it needs leadership practice.</p>
    <p>Leadership Gym exists to give you that edge. A place to show up, get better, and track the progress. Not for show, not for likes. Just for you.</p>
    <p>Welcome to the Gym.</p>
